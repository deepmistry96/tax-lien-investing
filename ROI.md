ROI is the return on investment


# Calculating ROI
annual net profit / your investment = "cash on cash" ROI 

Example: 

Memphis, TN 

- 8 plex
- FMV = 280k
- emergency exit strat  = Firesell - sell at 200k for a 10k loss
- down payment is 40k
- mortgage is 170k with a PMCF of $800


800$ * 12 = 9600 a year for a 40k downpayment. 



Here are two potential options
 - flipping return - The upside is 70k on selling the property and the potential downside is 10k 
- rental property - 9600 a year / 40k is 24% ROI



Example 2: 

Memphis, TN 

- 8 plex
- FMV = 280k
- emergency exit strat  = Firesell - sell at 200k for a 10k loss
- down payment is 40k funded by a hard money loan @ 8% a month
- mortgage is 170k and PITI  1190 a month
- total rent coming in is 4k a month 


Monthly income:
- money coming in 4k 

Monthly costs :
- interest costs a month =  40000 * .08 = 3200 a month
- PITI is 1190


The monthly 4000 - 3200 - 1190



Potential options:
- flip - ROI is 70k / 210k is 33% 
	- costs 210k and can sell for 280k, so that is an immediate 70k of equity
	- it costs us 390 a month, so that gives us 180 months to find a buyer @ the 
- rent has a monthly income of (-390) which will chip away at your balance sheet ( the 70k of equity from (FMV - Cost) till you can pay off the loan. 
	- not worth it, you lose 390 a month, with these numbers, you lose money till you sell. 
- refinance 
	- 70k equity @ 80% LTV
