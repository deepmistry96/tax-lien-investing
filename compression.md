# Compression in Tax Sales

## Overview
Compression is an auction mechanism used to efficiently process large volumes of tax liens or deeds in a single day. It automatically adjusts bid rates to streamline the bidding process.

## Types of Compression
1. Compress Down (Lien Auctions)
   - Starts with highest interest rate
   - Compresses to just below second-highest bid
   - Used in [[tax-lien]] sales
   - Focuses on interest rate reduction

2. Compress Up (Deed Auctions)
   - Starts with lowest premium bid
   - Compresses to just above second-lowest bid
   - Used in [[tax-deed-auction]]
   - Focuses on premium amount

## How It Works
1. Pre-Auction Phase
   - Bidders submit initial bids
   - System collects all bid amounts
   - Establishes baseline rates/amounts

2. Compression Phase
   - System identifies winning bid
   - Locates next closest bid
   - Adjusts winning bid by 1 basis point
   - Creates final compressed rate

## Example
For a Lien Auction (Compress Down):
- Bidder A: 16% interest
- Bidder B: 12% interest
- Bidder C: 8% interest
- Result: Winning bid (C) compresses to 11.99%

### Why does [[compression]] exist? 
This is because the fact that the county needs to be able to sell 10s of thousand of liens in a single day. What they do is open up the aution before hand for bids. 


### How does [[compression]] work?
On the day of the bid, all  the bids are accepted and the lowest or the highest bid is considered the baseline. Then depending on if the auction is "compress up" or "compress down", the min/max bid will automatically jump to 1 basis point off from the next closest bid. This was done to make these auctions more attractive to the investor market.

[[compression]] looks for the 2nd place loser and the true cost of the
