#tax-lien-specific


This can be used to motivate the auction to fail.
If the auction fails, then the tax lien owner (hopefully you), gets the property.
This needs to be filed in order for it to take action.
This is not always an option, but it can be powerful when it is. 

If the auction closes, and the hidden minimum reserve is not met, then the property goes to the lien holder.  

The whole point of this is to obscure the starting price, the starting price will not be able to be changed. 

There are some strategies to anticipate if there might be an [[HMR]] (hidden minimum reserve)
- the auction starts at 1k 
- the price is nowhere near [[MAO]] 
	- if it is less than [[MAO]] then bid, and let it compress
