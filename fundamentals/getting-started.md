# Getting Started with Tax Lien Investing

## What is Tax Lien Investing?
Tax lien investing involves purchasing [[tax-deed-investing|tax lien certificates]] from local governments when property owners fail to pay their property taxes. As an investor, you essentially pay the tax debt on behalf of the property owner and receive:
- The right to collect the paid tax amount
- Interest on your investment (rates vary by state)
