# Return on Investment (ROI) in Tax Lien Investing
#core-concept

## Basic ROI Formula
ROI = (Net Profit / Total Investment) × 100

## Tax Lien Specific ROI Calculations

### Simple Tax Lien ROI
```plaintext
ROI = (Interest Earned + Penalties) / (Tax Lien Amount) × 100
```

Example:
- Tax Lien Purchase: $5,000
- Interest Rate: 16%
- Redemption Period: 1 year
- ROI = ($800 / $5,000) × 100 = 16%

### Advanced Tax Lien ROI
Including all costs:
```plaintext
ROI = (Interest + Penalties - Costs) / (Tax Lien + Additional Costs) × 100
```

Costs to Consider:
- Research costs
- Legal fees
- Title search fees
- Administrative costs
- Opportunity costs

## ROI Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Redemption
- Tax Lien Amount: $10,000
- Interest Rate: 18%
- Holding Period: 6 months
- Research Costs: $200
```plaintext
Interest Earned = $10,000 × 18% × (6/12) = $900
ROI = ($900 - $200) / ($10,000 + $200) × 100 = 6.8%
```

### Scenario 2: Property Acquisition
When the property doesn't redeem:
```plaintext
ROI = (Property Value - Total Costs) / Total Investment × 100
```

Example:
- Tax Lien: $15,000
- Legal Costs: $3,000
- Property Value: $100,000
```plaintext
ROI = ($100,000 - $18,000) / $18,000 × 100 = 456%
```

## Risk-Adjusted ROI

Consider these factors when calculating risk-adjusted returns:
1. Property condition
2. Location risk
3. Market conditions
4. Redemption likelihood
5. Legal complications

Risk Adjustment Formula:
```plaintext
Risk-Adjusted ROI = Expected ROI × Risk Factor
```

Risk Factors:
- Low Risk: 0.9 - 1.0
- Medium Risk: 0.7 - 0.9
- High Risk: 0.5 - 0.7

## Tax Implications

ROI calculations should consider:
1. Interest income is taxed as ordinary income
2. Property sale profits may be taxed as:
   - Short-term capital gains (held < 1 year)
   - Long-term capital gains (held > 1 year)

## Comparing Investment Options

### Example: Tax Lien vs Rental Property

Tax Lien:
- Investment: $40,000
- Annual Return: 16%
- Low maintenance
- Shorter term
- Less control

Rental Property:
- Down Payment: $40,000
- Property Value: $200,000
- Monthly Rent: $2,000
- PITI: $1,190
- Maintenance: $200/month
```plaintext
Annual Cash Flow = ($2,000 - $1,190 - $200) × 12 = $7,320
Cash-on-Cash ROI = ($7,320 / $40,000) × 100 = 18.3%
```

## Best Practices

1. Calculate multiple ROI scenarios
2. Include ALL costs in calculations
3. Consider time value of money
4. Account for risks
5. Compare with other investment options
6. Keep detailed records
7. Review actual vs projected ROI

## Red Flags

Watch for:
1. Unrealistic ROI projections
2. Hidden costs
3. Unclear redemption terms
4. Title issues
5. Environmental problems

Remember: Higher ROI often means higher risk. Always perform thorough due diligence.


# Calculating ROI
annual net profit / your investment = "cash on cash" ROI 

Example: 

Memphis, TN 

- 8 plex
- FMV = 280k
- emergency exit strat  = Firesell - sell at 200k for a 10k loss
- down payment is 40k
- mortgage is 170k with a PMCF of $800


800$ * 12 = 9600 a year for a 40k downpayment. 



Here are two potential options
 - flipping return - The upside is 70k on selling the property and the potential downside is 10k 
- rental property - 9600 a year / 40k is 24% ROI



Example 2: 

Memphis, TN 

- 8 plex
- FMV = 280k
- emergency exit strat  = Firesell - sell at 200k for a 10k loss
- down payment is 40k funded by a hard money loan @ 8% a month
- mortgage is 170k and PITI  1190 a month
- total rent coming in is 4k a month 


Monthly income:
- money coming in 4k 

Monthly costs :
- interest costs a month =  40000 * .08 = 3200 a month
- PITI is 1190


The monthly 4000 - 3200 - 1190



Potential options:
- flip - ROI is 70k / 210k is 33% 
	- costs 210k and can sell for 280k, so that is an immediate 70k of equity
	- it costs us 390 a month, so that gives us 180 months to find a buyer @ the 
- rent has a monthly income of (-390) which will chip away at your balance sheet ( the 70k of equity from (FMV - Cost) till you can pay off the loan. 
	- not worth it, you lose 390 a month, with these numbers, you lose money till you sell. 
- refinance 
	- 70k equity @ 80% LTV
