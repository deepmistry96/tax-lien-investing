# PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance) in Tax Lien Investing

PITI is a fundamental concept in tax lien investing that helps assess property affordability, owner financial stability, and investment risk. Understanding PITI is crucial for evaluating both redemption likelihood and potential property acquisition scenarios.

## Components

### Principal
- Original loan balance reduction
- Amortization schedule impact
- Equity building rate

### Interest
- Mortgage interest rates
- [[tax lien interest rates]]
- Additional financing costs

### Taxes
- Property tax assessments
- Special assessments
- Tax lien amounts
- Future tax projections

### Insurance
- Property insurance
- Flood insurance requirements
- Mortgage insurance (PMI/MIP)
- Special hazard coverage

## Tax Lien Specific Applications

### 1. Redemption Analysis
Calculate Total Monthly Burden:
```plaintext
Monthly Burden = PITI + Tax Lien Payment Requirements
```

Example:
- Current PITI: $1,500
- Monthly Tax Lien Payment: $300
- Total Burden: $1,800

### 2. Affordability Assessment
```plaintext
Affordability Ratio = Total Monthly Burden / Area Median Monthly Income
```

Risk Levels:
- Low Risk: < 30%
- Moderate Risk: 30-40%
- High Risk: > 40%

## PITI Calculations

### Basic Monthly PITI
```plaintext
Monthly PITI = P + I + (Annual Taxes/12) + (Annual Insurance/12)
```

Example:
- Loan: $200,000 @ 5%
- Annual Taxes: $4,800
- Annual Insurance: $1,200
```plaintext
P&I = $1,073.64
Taxes = $400/month
Insurance = $100/month
Total PITI = $1,573.64
```

### Post-Tax Lien PITI
```plaintext
New PITI = Current PITI + (Tax Lien Repayment/Months)
```

Example:
- Current PITI: $1,573.64
- Tax Lien: $6,000
- Repayment Period: 12 months
```plaintext
Monthly Addition = $6,000/12 = $500
New PITI = $1,573.64 + $500 = $2,073.64
```

## Risk Assessment Ratios

### 1. Front-End Ratio
```plaintext
Front-End = Monthly PITI / Monthly Gross Income
```
Thresholds:
- Conservative: < 28%
- Standard: 28-33%
- High Risk: > 33%

### 2. Back-End Ratio
```plaintext
Back-End = (PITI + Other Debts) / Monthly Gross Income
```
Thresholds:
- Conservative: < 36%
- Standard: 36-43%
- High Risk: > 43%

## Investment Strategy Applications

### 1. Property Acquisition Analysis
If foreclosure occurs, evaluate:
- Potential rental income vs PITI

- Area affordability metrics
- [[ROI]] with PITI carrying costs

### 2. Exit Strategy Planning

4. Multiple tax defaults

### Opportunity Signals
