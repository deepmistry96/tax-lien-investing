# PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance)
#core-concept

## Overview
PITI represents the four main components of a mortgage payment:
- **P**rincipal: The amount that pays down your loan balance
- **I**nterest: The cost of borrowing money
- **T**axes: Property taxes
- **I**nsurance: Both property and mortgage insurance

## Importance in Tax Lien Investing

### 1. Property Analysis
When evaluating tax liens, understanding PITI helps:
- Assess property owner's financial burden
- Estimate likelihood of redemption
- Calculate potential carrying costs if foreclosure occurs

### 2. Monthly Payment Calculation
```plaintext
Monthly PITI = Principal + Interest + (Annual Taxes/12) + (Annual Insurance/12)
```

Example:
- Loan Amount: $200,000
- Interest Rate: 5%
- Annual Taxes: $4,800
- Annual Insurance: $1,200

```plaintext
Principal & Interest = $1,073.64
Monthly Tax = $400
Monthly Insurance = $100
Total PITI = $1,573.64
```

### 3. Risk Assessment
High PITI payments relative to property value may indicate:
- Higher risk of future tax defaults
- Potential maintenance issues
- Cash flow problems for current owner

## PITI Ratios

### Front-End Ratio
```plaintext
Monthly PITI / Monthly Gross Income = Front-End Ratio
```
- Ideal: Below 28%
- Warning Sign: Above 35%

### Back-End Ratio
```plaintext
(Monthly PITI + Other Debt Payments) / Monthly Gross Income = Back-End Ratio
```
- Ideal: Below 36%
- Warning Sign: Above 43%

## Application in Tax Lien Strategy

### Due Diligence
1. Calculate current PITI
2. Compare to local rental rates
3. Assess market sustainability
4. Review tax assessment history

### Risk Mitigation
1. Higher PITI = Higher risk of:
   - Continued tax defaults
   - Property abandonment
   - Maintenance issues

2. Lower PITI = Better prospects for:
   - Owner redemption
   - Property resale
   - Rental conversion

## Red Flags
1. PITI > 45% of area median income
2. Rising tax assessments
3. Insurance issues (flood zones, etc.)
4. Historical tax delinquencies

## Opportunities
1. PITI < 30% of area median income
2. Stable tax history
3. Standard insurance rates
4. Strong rental market

Remember: PITI analysis helps predict both redemption likelihood and potential property performance if acquired through foreclosure.
