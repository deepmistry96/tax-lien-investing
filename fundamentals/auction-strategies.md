# Tax Lien Auction Strategies and Bidding Guide

## Types of Auctions

### 1. Interest Rate Auctions
#### Process
- Bidding starts at maximum rate
- Rate decreases with each bid
- Lowest rate wins

#### Strategy
```plaintext
Minimum Acceptable Rate = Holding Costs + Risk Premium + Profit Margin

Where:
Holding Costs = Financing + Admin + Legal
Risk Premium = Base Risk × Property Factor
Profit Margin = Minimum Required Return
```

### 2. Premium Bid Auctions
#### Process
- Fixed interest rate
- Bid amount above lien
- Highest premium wins
- Common in Arizona

#### Strategy
```plaintext
Maximum Premium = Expected Return - (Holding Costs + Risk Adjustment)

Where:
Expected Return = Interest + Penalties
Risk Adjustment = Risk Factor × Premium Amount
```
