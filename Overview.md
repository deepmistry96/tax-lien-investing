# Tax Lien Investing Overview

## Introduction to Tax Liens and Tax Deeds

Tax lien and tax deed investing are strategies that allow investors to purchase either:
- The right to collect unpaid property taxes (tax liens)
- The actual property through tax deed sales (tax deeds)

### Why Consider Tax Lien Investing?
- Potential for high interest returns (varies by state, typically 12-36%)
- Secured by real estate
- Lower capital requirements compared to traditional real estate investing
- Possibility of property acquisition below market value

### Key Differences: Tax Liens vs Tax Deeds
| Aspect | Tax Liens | Tax Deeds |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| What you buy | Right to collect taxes | The actual property |
| Initial investment | Usually smaller | Usually larger |
| Primary return | Interest payments | Property equity |
| Timeline | Redemption period | Immediate ownership |
