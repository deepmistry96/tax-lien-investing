The county has the ability to cloud the tile on the deed for 18 months, this limits your options. 

Example: If you spend 300K on a lien to a deed conversion or a redemption deed, then you can have a large amount of money tied up in a property for at least 18 months before you are allowed to sell. 

You may be able to rent the property, or do something with it, but you can not sell. 

If you really want to free up capital there is at least one option that you have. 

Almost no mortgage company is typically willing to refinance a mortgage on a deed that has a clouded title. 

Some investors really value the [[MAO]] formula, if you purchase the property for [[MAO]] or less, some companies like (taxlien) will be willing to provide you with liquidity and allow you to refinance the purchase, free-ing up capital.
