# [[[[bid down]]]]


bidding down is a concept in auctioning where the price starts at the highest it can be and then the bidding starts to see who is willing to take the lowest. 

The example that is used is bidding down on the interest rate on a lien. 

The counter concept to this is "[[[[bid up]]]]"
