# What to Expect with Tax Liens

## The basic premise.
When dealing with tax liens, exect the house to have issues. The true cost of doing business is closer to 3x the original price of the lien. 

### Messy houses
A messy house is a house that looks bad, but it isnt anything that cant be cleaned up. 
Messy houses tend to scare investors away, but they are not a deal killer. 
Infact, messy houses are a great way to find a good deal. 
Often these messy houses are a result of a person with a mental illness, or a person who has passed away. 
Or they have a drug issue.
Do your research, and if you are comfortable with the property, then you can make a good deal.

## The 3x rule
When you buy the lien you are not done. That purchase of the lien from the county indemnified the county, and that was all that they were interested in doing. Dont expect their help to take you to the finish line. Any costs required to get the propery in a state that is worth putting on the market are on you. Indiviually, each cost is not huge on its own, but when you add them all up, they can be a significant cost. 

## The finish line
One of the many [[traps of tax liens]] is not making it to the finish line.
