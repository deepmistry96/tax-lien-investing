If you win the bid on the lien, and then they are delinquent for long enough for the property to make it to auction, and then no one bids on it . . . that is now your house. 

What if there is someone living there already? 

Depending on the state, this may be a minor or a major issue. 

In a state like California, this is a major issue. In a state like Texas, not so much. Every state has different levels of protection for squatters. 

If the property was owner occupied, well, no one wants to evict a family, but that is your property now and the county will expect to collect their yearly tax from the new property owner (you).
