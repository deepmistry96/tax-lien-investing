# maximum allowable offer


The formula to determine the quitting point on a bid is by 
ARV - actual retail value

ARV subtracted by:
- repair costs  (variable)
- legal fees (~ 1%)
- holding costs (~ 3%)
- sales costs (~ 3%)
- anticipated profit (~ 10%-20%)
- "fudge" factor (~ 4%)
- wholesale margin (5k+)
Equals:
The maximum allowable offer (at a deed auction)

---
On the flip side the math works out for the buyer since reversing the math from the maximum allowable offer value back up to the ARV returns a price where the seller can also make a healthy margin if the house sold for the ARV on the market. 


This formula demonstrates the symbiosis that can take place in lien markets. 
 - The county gets indemnified and allows the government to continue to pay for public good and services: firefighters, police, teachers, construction workers, park maintenance, etc 
 - You make profit on securing the lien
 - The purchaser of the home makes money fli
