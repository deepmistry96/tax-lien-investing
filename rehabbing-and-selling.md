- as is 
- close in 1 hour

## Order of operations for rehabbing 

1 - Roof 
2 - Core 
3 - out


## Priority
Put in the least amount required to get up to you maximum allowable offer so that it can be sold to a flipper or wholesaler who is willing to take it to the next level. We dont need to play all the positions. Get the profit and get out. Dont think too much and keep it simple.
