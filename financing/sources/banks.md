## The big 6 banks

Wells Fargo 
Bank of America
Chase 
Citi
US Bank
Dauche Bank


It is recommended to not do business with the big 6 banks. This is because they are just not that fun to deal with. In some cases, it may be that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. See how that might be frustrating


One way to get more insight into the bank, you can ask for the 10k report. Anyone is allowed to request this report, and you want to look for the [[NPL]] line

NPL stands for non-performing loans. NPL is anything that is more than 91 days late. If the NPL line is 5% or higher, they are on the FDIC watch list. 5% of the total number of loans on the book.
