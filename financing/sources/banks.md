- [[required-documents|Extensive documentation requirements]]
- [[financing-risk-assessment|Strict underwriting]]

## Due Diligence on Banks

- Review [[interest-rates|rate structures]]
- Assess [[financing-options|loan programs]]
- Verify [[FDIC]] status

### Red Flags

## Documentation Requirements
