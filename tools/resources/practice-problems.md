What is the MAO?

You're correct; we need to include the additional costs as outlined. Here's the updated formula with the adjustments:

MAO=ARV−(Profit Margin+Repair Costs+Wholesale Fee+Fudge Factor+Sales Costs+Holding Costs+Legal Fees)\text{MAO} = \text{ARV} - (\text{Profit Margin} + \text{Repair Costs} + \text{Wholesale Fee} + \text{Fudge Factor} + \text{Sales Costs} + \text{Holding Costs} + \text{Legal Fees})

**Given:**

- ARV = $420,000
- Profit Margin = 20% of ARV = $84,000
- Repair Costs = $31,000
- Wholesale Fee = $7,500
- Fudge Factor = 4% of ARV = 0.04×420,000=16,8000.04 \times 420,000 = 16,800
- Sales Costs = 3% of ARV = 0.03×420,000=12,6000.03 \times 420,000 = 12,600
- Holding Costs = 3% of ARV = 0.03×420,000=12,6000.03 \times 420,000 = 12,600
- Legal Fees = 1% of ARV = 0.01×420,000=4,2000.01 \times 420,000 = 4,200

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate total deductions:**
    
    Total Deductions=Profit Margin+Repair Costs+Wholesale Fee+Fudge Factor+Sales Costs+Holding Costs+Legal Fees\text{Total Deductions} = \text{Profit Margin} + \text{Repair Costs} + \text{Wholesale Fee} + \text{Fudge Factor} + \text{Sales Costs} + \text{Holding Costs} + \text{Legal Fees} 84,000+31,000+7,500+16,800+12,600+12,600+4,200=168,70084,000 + 31,000 + 7,500 + 16,800 + 12,600 + 12,600 + 4,200 = 168,700
2. **Subtract total deductions from ARV:**
    
    MAO=420,000−168,700\text{MAO} = 420,000 - 168,700 MAO=251,300\text{MAO} = 251,300

### Final Answer:

The **Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)** for this property, accounting for all costs, is **$251,300**.
```




ARV - 721,000
anticipated repairs - 68,000
wholesale fee is 21% of the investors profit, this is 
we are the wholesaler
plug these numbers in and determine the MAO

```

To calculate the **Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)** in this scenario where you are the wholesaler, we need to include the wholesale fee as part of the deductions. The wholesale fee is specified as **21% of the investor's profit**. Here’s how to calculate it step by step.

### **Formula Recap**

MAO=ARV−(Investor’s Profit+Repair Costs+Wholesale Fee)\text{MAO} = \text{ARV} - (\text{Investor's Profit} + \text{Repair Costs} + \text{Wholesale Fee})

#### **Known Values**

- ARV = $721,000
- Repair Costs = $68,000
- Wholesale Fee = 21%21\% of Investor’s Profit (to be calculated)

---

### **Assumptions and Calculation Process**

1. **Set Investor’s Desired Profit as 20% of ARV:**
    
    Investor’s Profit=20%×721,000=144,200\text{Investor's Profit} = 20\% \times 721,000 = 144,200
2. **Calculate Wholesale Fee as 21% of Investor’s Profit:**
    
    Wholesale Fee=21%×144,200=30,282\text{Wholesale Fee} = 21\% \times 144,200 = 30,282
3. **Total Deductions:**
    
    Total Deductions=Investor’s Profit+Repair Costs+Wholesale Fee\text{Total Deductions} = \text{Investor's Profit} + \text{Repair Costs} + \text{Wholesale Fee} Total Deductions=144,200+68,000+30,282=242,482\text{Total Deductions} = 144,200 + 68,000 + 30,282 = 242,482
4. **Subtract Deductions from ARV:**
    
    MAO=ARV−Total Deductions\text{MAO} = \text{ARV} - \text{Total Deductions} MAO=721,000−242,482=478,518\text{MAO} = 721,000 - 242,482 = 478,518

---

### **Final Answer**

The **Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)** for this scenario is **$478,518**.
