Example: 

Memphis, TN 

- 8 plex
- FMV = 280k
- emergency exit strat  = Firesell - sell at 200k for a 10k loss
- down payment is 40k
- mortgage is 170k with a PMCF of $800


800$ * 12 = 9600 a year for a 40k downpayment. 



Here are two potential options
 - flipping return - The upside is 70k on selling the property and the potential downside is 10k 
- rental property - 9600 a year / 40k is 24% ROI



Example 2: 

Memphis, TN 

- 8 plex
- FMV = 280k
- emergency exit strat  = Firesell - sell at 200k for a 10k loss
- down payment is 40k funded by a hard money loan @ 8% a month
- mortgage is 170k and PITI  1190 a month
- total rent coming in is 4k a month 


Monthly income:
- money coming in 4k 

Monthly costs :
- interest costs a month =  40000 * .08 = 3200 a month
- PITI is 1190


The monthly 4000 - 3200 - 1190



Potential options:
- flip - ROI is 70k / 210k is 33% 
	- costs 210k and can sell for 280k, so that is an immediate 70k of equity
	- it costs us 390 a month, so that gives us 180 months to find a buyer @ the 
- rent has a monthly income of (-390) which will chip away at your balance sheet ( the 70k of equity from (FMV - Cost) till you can pay off the loan. 
	- not worth it, you lose 390 a month, with these numbers, you lose money till you sell. 
- refinance 
	- 70k equity @ 80% LTV 


Example 3:

Own a single family residence

FMV - 200k 

paid retail @ 200k 

 put 20% down

PITI - 1100 

rented @ 200 PMCF 


Potential options:
- flip - not an option, paid retail
- rent - that is what you are doing on a downward trajectory
- refinance - pmcf - piti is 200 - 1100 is a loss of 900 
- Modified subject 2, sandwich lease option,  with a simultaneous close
- straight lease option
	- 220k with a 20% premium
	- 
- could take the rest 



Using the straight lease option:
3 year lease option 
NROC = 8k
Lease payments of 1560 via the 20% premium  (1300 * 1.2)
1560 - 1100 = a PMCF of 460
@ 3% appreciation, property will sell @ 218,545.40
At the end of the 3 year lease option vlaue
460
