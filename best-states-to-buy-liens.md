# Best States to Buy Liens
#location-based

## Florida
The returns are pretty phenomenal in Florida. They have a pretty strong market, and from recent trends, it has been one of the fastest growing states in the US.

## Arizona
There is this something to be mindful of when buying a lien . . . You are only buying the lien that was placed on a property by the county for a single year. There is a waiting period that must be respected, so it would be really nice to have the right to purchase the next year's lien without having to compete for it. This is called "[[first right of refusal]]" 

## Colorado
Colorado is the only other state in the United States that respects "[[first right of refusal]]". New investors can be weary of getting roped into doing business with someone that they dont know. 


## Texas
Since we live in Texas, we really understand the different cities and we know what to buy. Texas is also a massive state with Houston (4th largest city in US), San Antonio (8th largest city in the US), Dallas (9th largest city in US), Austin(10th largest city in the US), Fort Worth(13th largest city in the US). 

Seriously, the market is big with room for lots of players and action happening constantly. 



## [[first right of refusal]]

A "[[first right of refusal]]" is ==a contractual right that gives a specific party the priority to purchase an asset or property before the owner can sell it to anyone else==, essentially allowing them to match any offer made by a third party and buy the asset if they choose to do so
